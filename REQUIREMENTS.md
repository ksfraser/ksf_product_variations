= FrontAccounting Product Variations Module =

== Core Features ==
* '''Module Registration'''
  * Registered the module in ''installed_modules.php''.
  * Integrated a new '''Product Variations tab''' into the Stock app via ''hooks.php''.
* '''Dynamic Routing'''
  * Built a generic router to dynamically determine controllers and methods based on the URL structure (e.g., `/attributes/list` -> `AttributeController::list()`).
* '''Variation Generation'''
  * Created a screen to '''select a base product''' and applicable attributes.
  * Automatically generated variations using:
    * '''Stock IDs''' based on abbreviated attribute values (e.g., `shirt-XL-Red-Wool`).
    * '''Short Descriptions''' with full attribute names (e.g., `Extra Large Red Wool Shirt`).
  * Implemented database storage for generated variations.

== Supporting Functionality ==
* '''Prepopulate Attributes'''
  * Populated the ''fa_product_attributes'' table based on the '''Royal Order of Adjectives'''.
  * Populated the ''fa_product_attribute_values'' table with common values and '''abbreviations'''.
* '''Preview Variations'''
  * Added a '''Preview screen''' to display generated variations before saving.
  * Displayed '''Stock ID''' and '''Short Description''' for review.
  * Provided a '''Preview button''' alongside '''Generate Variations'''.
* '''Editable Preview'''
  * Allowed inline editing of '''Stock ID''' and '''Short Description''' in the preview screen.
  * Added a '''Final Save button''' to commit variations to the database after edits.

== Interface Enhancements ==
* '''Admin Screen'''
  * Included an admin screen with a button to '''prepopulate attributes and values'''.
  * Added a '''Confirmation screen''' after prepopulation, listing all inserted attributes and values.
* '''Route Listing'''
  * Built an index screen listing all available routes (controllers/methods) and views for navigation.

== Data Handling ==
* '''Database Updates'''
  * Extended ''fa_product_attribute_values'' with an '''abbreviation column''' to support Stock ID generation.
  * Defined the structure for storing variations (''fa_product_variations'' table) with:
    * ''main_product_id''
    * ''variation_stock_id''
    * ''attribute_values''
* '''Editable Variations'''
  * Added functionality to '''collect edited variations''' via JSON in the preview screen and save changes to the database.

== Validation & Usability ==
* '''Guard Rails'''
  * Validated attribute data (e.g., no empty abbreviations or duplicate values).
  * Checked for duplicate variations during generation.
* '''User Experience'''
  * Allowed users to review, edit, and save variations in a seamless flow.
  * Enhanced usability with clear navigation links, buttons, and inline editing.

== Modular Design ==
* '''Generic Controllers'''
  * Dynamically registered controllers and methods using a generic router.
  * Designed a modular structure to allow future extensions (e.g., reports, user management).
* '''Scalability'''
  * Structured the system to handle additional attributes, values, and variations without major changes.
  * Designed the workflow to accommodate other product types beyond clothing.

== Summary ==
This module offers robust functionality to manage product variations efficiently, supporting dynamic routing, user-friendly interfaces, and flexible scalability. The thoughtful design ensures easy integration into FrontAccounting while maintaining adaptability for future enhancements.
